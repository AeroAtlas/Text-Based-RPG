## Summary
A web browser RPG game made with React to try and bring the interactivity of a website (and eventually a mobile phone) to an RPG.
Along with the usual multiple choice input, it has the ability to put in your own custom words in and get unique responses!
This is meant to be a shorter game with high replayability for any user to enjoy either vanilla or by making their own path.

## Instructions

* Log-In or Sign-Up to save your game/character

* Start the game by clicking one of 4 choices or writing in your own response

* Includes Inventory in the Navbar and to the side along with a description of the character

* As the game progresses you will obtain or lose items, stats, money, and ammo

* You can also input your own text at the bottom of the multiple choice selection to get a unique response

* The goal is to get to the end and defeat the final boss
